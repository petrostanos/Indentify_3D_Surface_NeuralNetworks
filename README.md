# Indentify_3D_Surface_NeuralNetworks
The principal curvatures of 3-D surface is selected as learning feature for neural networks. PREMONN (PREdictive MOdular Neural Networks) is the architecture of neural networks. In this technique many of simple neural networks are developed and trained in a small area of surface, instead of one big neural network in total surface.
